Hello, future students! If you end up here, it's because you were redirected not by me, but by Mr. Suter. The decision to make this open source was so that others could add, change, and remove items. There's a good chance I won't make it to the VR stage. If you are going down that road, I request you fork this project and add support from there. Due to restrictions (I work at Christoffen), I will not have time to provide maintenance.
